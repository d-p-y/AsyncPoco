# AsyncPocoDpy

AsyncPocoDpy is a fork of [AsyncPoco](https://github.com/tmenier/AsyncPoco). I've added "array parameters support" that is currently supported by PostgreSQL. In the future I may decide to support SQL Server as well.
This feature [has been proposed](https://github.com/tmenier/AsyncPoco/issues/53) to be merged into AsyncPoco.
